Introduction
-----------
TensorFlow is an open source software library for high performance numerical
computation primarily used in machine learning. Its flexible architecture
allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of types of platforms
(CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and a range of systems from single desktops to clusters
of servers to mobile and edge devices.

The build system of TensorFlow is Bazel (https://bazel.build/).

This layer integrates TensorFlow to OE/Yocto platform
- Integrate Google's bazel to Yocto
- Add Yocto toolchain for bazel to support cross compiling.
- Replace python package system(pip/wheel) with Yocto package system(rpm/deb/ipk).
